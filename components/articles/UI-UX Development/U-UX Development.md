UI/UX design aims to create a positive user experience that encourages customers to stick with a brand or product. While a UX Designer decides how the user interface works, the UI designer decides how the user interface looks. This article is a comprehensive guide on how to become a UI UX Designer and discusses other relevant topics related to the UI UX field.

## What Is UI Design?

User-friendly interfaces are essential for digital products that are meant to be used by the general public. The look and feel of an app or website's user interface is referred to as user interface design. It's important to consider the aesthetics of digital iconography, including how they're displayed on a website and the relationships between them. Interface design includes features such as fonts, colors, graphics, buttons, and menus.

All of these design decisions work together to make it clear to users what can be clicked, touched, or swiped and which of the series of buttons is the most significant.

## What Is UX Design?

UX design, or user experience design, is the method by which design teams build products that meet the brand promise of a company while providing meaningful user experiences for customers. 

All aspects of the product's design and usability must be considered in order to ensure a positive user experience. Among the many responsibilities of a UI/UX Designer are conducting research and understanding user needs.

The entire process of purchasing, owning, and even troubleshooting a product is considered when designing a product that provides an excellent user experience. For the most part, user experience (UX) design aims to create an enjoyable and effective customer journey that enables the user to achieve their desired outcomes. 

Designers specializing in user experience (UX) study how people use products, conduct usability tests and iterate on their designs due to this input.

## What Do UX Designers Do?
All aspects of a product's development, from design to usability to function, are the responsibility of a UX Designer. Users' end-to-end contact with a product is at the heart of their work, including seeing new prospects for the product and company.
Given their broad scope, it's hardly surprising that UX Designers work on a wide range of projects and for a wide range of companies. According to one survey, UX design has more than 200 different job titles and a vast range of duties. 

User research, persona development, information architecture (IA), wireframing, prototyping and high-fidelity design, and user testing are some of the responsibilities of a UX Designer.

Skills Required to Become a UX Designer
If you wish to know how to become a UX Designer, you need to have these abilities.

1. UX Research Skills
Researchers and analysts who work on user experience projects should be able to collect and analyze both qualitative and quantitative data on their subjects. 

Research methods used include user interviews (either open-ended or structured), user observation in the real world or a controlled testing environment, survey distribution, and focus groups.

2. Ability to Wireframe and Prototype
A wireframe is a visual representation of the page's layout for a website. An effective user experience begins with a well-thought-out user interface and user experience (UI/UX) design decisions on which features should be shown and which should be hidden, as well as where and how they should be displayed visually. 

You must be able to draw diagrams of UI elements like images, CTA buttons, and menus. Mockups, or early versions of a product, are made to test a concept or procedure after the wireframes have been accepted.

3. UX Writing Skills
Writing about user experience (UX) is a specialized skill set. Microcopy, or the words we read or hear when using a digital product, is a critical component of website navigability and the overall experience. Having strong UX writing abilities can help you achieve this goal.
