# Data Structures & Algorithms Roadmap  
  
**Flowchart** is here:- [DSA Roadmap](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1k7BFqUNKiAEk1IrzbIobrNn-8FXG7ZUR/view?usp=sharing)  
  
Today’s world is highly reliable on data and their appropriate management through widely used apps and software. The backbone for appropriate management of data is Data Structure and Algorithms (for convenience here we will use the term DSA). It is a dream for many to achieve expertise in handling and creating these apps and software. With this target in mind, they set out on the journey of learning DSA. The very first step in the journey is the creation of a complete roadmap to learn data structure and algorithms.  
  
From creating **Games** to building **Social Media Algorithms**. DSA plays an integral part whether you want to build something of your own or either may be willing to get a job in big tech giants like **Google**, **Microsoft**, **Netflix** and more.  
  
Steps to learn **DSA** from scratch
The first and foremost thing is dividing the total procedure into little pieces which need to be done sequentially.  
  
The complete process to learn DSA from scratch can be broken into 5 parts:  
  
Learn a programming language of your choice  
Learn about Time and Space complexities  
Learn the basics of individual Data Structures and Algorithms  
Practice, Practice, and Practice more  
Compete and Become a Pro  
  
**Learn at least one Programming language**  
  
This should be your first step while starting to learn data structure and algorithms. We as human beings, before learning to write a sentence or an essay on a topic, first try to learn that language: the alphabet, letters, and punctuations in it, how and when to use them. The same goes for programming also.   
  
Firstly, select a language of your choice, be it Java, C, C++, Python, or any other language of your choice. Before learning how to code in that language you should learn about the building pieces of the language: the basic syntax, the data types, variables, operators, conditional statements, loops, functions, etc.  
  
**Learn about Complexities**    
  
Here comes one of the interesting and important topics. The primary motive to use DSA is to solve a problem effectively and efficiently. How can you decide if a program written by you is efficient or not? This is measured by complexities. Complexity is of two types:  
  
**Time Complexity:** Time complexity is used to measure the amount of time required to execute the code.  
  
**Space Complexity:** Space complexity means the amount of space required to execute successfully the functionalities of the code.
     
You will also come across the term Auxiliary Space very commonly in DSA, which refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.  
Both of the above complexities are measured with respect to the input parameters. But here arises a problem. The time required for executing a code depends on several factors, such as:  
  
The number of operations performed in the program,   
The speed of the device, and also  
The speed of data transfer if being executed on an online platform.   
  
It neglects the system-dependent constants and is related to only the number of modular operations being performed in the whole program. The following **3 asymptotic notations** are mostly used to represent the time complexity of algorithms:  
  
**Big-O Notation (Ο)** – Big-O notation specifically describes the worst-case scenario.  
**Omega Notation (Ω)** – Omega(Ω) notation specifically describes the best-case scenario.  
**Theta Notation (θ)** – This notation represents the average complexity of an algorithm.  
  
**Learn Data Structures and Algorithms**  
  
Here comes the most crucial and the most awaited stage of the roadmap for learning data structure and algorithm – the stage where you start learning about DSA. The topic of DSA consists of two parts:   
  
**Data Structures**  
**Algorithms**  
  
**Compete and Become A Pro**  
  
Now it is time to test out your skills and efficiency. The best possible way is to compete with others. This will help you find out your position among others and also give you a hint on the areas you are lacking.  

  
  
  
**Tips to boost your learning**
By far we have discussed in-depth the 5 crucial steps to learning DSA from scratch. During the complete journey on the roadmap to learn DSA, here are some tips which will surely help you:

Learn the **Fundamentals of chosen Programming Language** thoroughly 
Implement each small concept that you are learning. Make sure to learn the following concepts:

**Basic Syntax**
**Data Types**
**Operators, Variables, functions**
**Conditional Statement, loops**
**OOP(Object-Oriented Programming)**
**Get a good grasp of the Complexity Analysis**
Understand **how the complexity is calculated**, and try to solve multiple questions to find the complexities of programs. You can also try out our quiz on Analysis of Algorithms for better practice.

**Focus on Logic Building**
The best way to do this is to solve as many problems as you can from scratch, without looking into solutions or editorials. The more you solve, the more strong your logic building will be.
